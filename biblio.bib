It is not known, however, whether current US antihypertensive medication utilization patterns and the resulting degrees of blood pressure (BP) control are similar or different among hypertensive women and men.The study was a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of the noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Persons aged ≥18 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999–2004 were classified as hypertensive based on a BP ≥140/90 mm Hg, currently taking antihypertensive medication, or having been diagnosed by a physician.Among hypertensives, the prevalence of antihypertensive medication use was significantly higher among women than men (61.4\\% vs. 56.8\\%), especially among middle-aged persons (40–49 years, 53.1\\% vs. 42.7\\%) and among non-Hispanic blacks (65.5\\% vs. 54.6\\%). Also, treated women were more likely than men to use diuretics (31.6\\% vs. 22.3\\%) and angiotensin receptor blockers (11.3\\% vs. 8.7\\%). Among treated hypertensives, the proportion taking three or more antihypertensive drugs was lower among women than men, especially among older persons (60–69 years: 12.3\\% vs. 19.8\\%, 70–79 years: 18.6\\% vs. 21.2\\%, and ≥80 years: 18.8\\% vs. 22.8\\%). Only 44.8\\% of treated women achieved BP control vs. 51.1\\% of treated men.Hypertensive women are significantly more likely to be treated than men, but less likely to have achieved BP control. Additional efforts may be needed to achieve therapeutic goals for the US hypertensive population, especially for hypertensive women.}",

 abstract = {Working in the context of the linear model y = Xβ + ε, we generalize the concept of variance inflation as a measure of collinearity to a subset of parameters in β (denoted by β1, with the associated columns of X given by X1. The essential idea underlying this generalization is to examine the impact on the precision of estimation--in particular, the size of an ellipsoidal joint confidence region for β1--of less-than-optimal selection of other columns of the design matrix (X2), treating still other columns (X0) as unalterable, even hypothetically. In typical applications, X1 contains a set of dummy regressors coding categories of a qualitative variable or a set of polynomial regressors in a quantitative variable; X2 contains all other regressors in the model, save the constant, which is in X0. If σ2V denotes the realized variance of $\hat{\mathbf{\beta}}_1$ and σ2U is the variance associated with an optimal selection of X2, then the corresponding scaled dispersion ellipsoids to be compared are $\mathscr{E}_V = \{\mathbf{x}: \mathbf{x}'\mathbf{V}^{-1}\mathbf{x} \leq 1\}$ and $\mathscr{E}_U = \{\mathbf{x}: \mathbf{x}'\mathbf{U}^{-1} \mathbf{x} \leq 1\}$, where EU is contained in EV. The two ellipsoids can be compared by considering the radii of EV relative to EU, obtained through the spectral decomposition to V relative to U. We proceed to explore the geometry of generalized variance inflation, to show the relationship of these measures to correlation-matrix determinants and canonical correlations, to consider X matrices structured by relations of marginality among regressor subspaces, to develop the relationship of generalized variance inflation to hypothesis tests in the multivariate normal linear model, and to present several examples.},
