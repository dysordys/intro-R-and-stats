# Statistical inference in qualitative variables {#sec-inference-qualitative}

The previous chapters have focused on quantitative variables, except for the proportion or binomial tests of a specific category in a qualitative variable. If we want to compare groups of a  qualitative variables we are in this part of the book limited in the methods available. 

## $\chi^2$-test for independence
The *$\chi^2$-test for independence* (pronounced chi-square) is used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. It compares the observed frequencies in each category to the frequencies we would expect if the variables were independent.

## $\chi^2$-test for goodness-of-fit
The **$\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test** is used to determine if a sample data matches a population with a specific distribution. It compares the observed frequencies in each category to the expected frequencies based on the specified distribution.


## Exercises
The material to be analyzed in these exercises is a collection of phosphorus levels in 4189 lakes from different parts of Sweden. The phosphorus levels have been divided into five different condition classes. The data set can be found via [`lake-phosphorus.csv`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dysordys/intro-R-and-stats/main/data/lake-phosphorus.csv).

This task aims to analyze the collected data from the Swedish lakes. What we want to investigate is whether there is a dependency between condition class and region.

1. Formulate hypotheses that describe what you want to investigate and set the level of significance.

2. Show the expected values and check that the assumptions for the test has been fulfilled. 

3. Conduct the full test and interpret the results of the output. Does the data provide evidence that there is a dependency between the region of Sweden and the amount of phosphorus in the lakes?
